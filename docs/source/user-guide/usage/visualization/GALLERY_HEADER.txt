Visualization in wulfric is implemented with |plotly|_.

First, one need to create an instance of the plotting engine as

.. doctest::

    >>> import wulfric
    >>> pe = wulfric.PlotlyEngine()

The creation of the plotting engine can take one optional argument: ``fig``:

.. doctest::

    >>> from plotly import graph_objects as go
    >>> fig = go.Figure()
    >>> pe = wulfric.PlotlyEngine(fig=fig)

After plotting the figure can be either displayed

.. doctest::

    >>> pe.show(width=1000, height=800) # doctest: +SKIP

or saved as an .html file

.. doctest::

    >>> pe.save(output_name="wulfric-plot.html", width=1000, height=800) # doctest: +SKIP

:py:class:`.PlotlyEngine` has a number of methods that can be used to plot cell, atoms,
lattice and so on. Here is a set of examples, that show how to use it
