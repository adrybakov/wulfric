Dependency on the |spglib|_ was introduced.

0.4.0
-----
The changes are described above and:

* Add :py:class:`.StandardizationTypeMismatch` exception.
* Function ``Kpoints.coordinates()`` is removed, use :py:meth:`.Kpoints.ticks()` instead.
* Setter for the :py:meth:`.Lattice.kpoints` is removed to avoid confusion.
* Fix the bag with :py:meth:`.Lattice.copy`and :py:meth:`.Crystal.copy`: the ``return``
  statement was missing.
* Remove ``TRANSFORM_TO_CONVENTIONAL`` from ``wulfric.constants``. It was substituted by
  ``C_MATRICES``.
