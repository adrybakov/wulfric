Version 0.4
***********

.. warning::

  This version introduces some breaking changes. Please read carefully the
  following release notes.


Whats new?
----------
Explicit standardization of the cell is no longer required! Previously the user had to
explicitly standardize the cell of the crystal in order to have access to the high
symmetry k points. Now the standardization **matrix** is computed and used to map the
relative coordinates from the standard primitive cell to the actual primitive cell of the
lattice/crystal.

Documentation of the Bravais lattices and on formal notation used in the package was
drastically improved. Please visit the user guide to see the changes.


0.4.0
-----
The changes are described above and:

* Add :py:class:`.StandardizationTypeMismatch` exception.
* Function ``Kpoints.coordinates()`` is removed, use :py:meth:`.Kpoints.ticks()` instead.
* Setter for the :py:meth:`.Lattice.kpoints` is removed to avoid confusion.
* Fix the bag with :py:meth:`.Lattice.copy`and :py:meth:`.Crystal.copy`: the ``return``
  statement was missing.
* Remove ``TRANSFORM_TO_CONVENTIONAL`` from ``wulfric.constants``. It was substituted by
  ``C_MATRICES``.
