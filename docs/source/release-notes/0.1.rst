Whats new?
----------
WULFRIC was separated from `RAD-tools <https://rad-tools.org>`_. It is now a
standalone project, which can be used in any Python project.

0.1.0
=====

Initial release

0.1.1
=====

Bugfix with matplotlib imports. The imports were not shielded, thus if matplotlib was
not installed in the users environment, the execution would fail. Plotly was shielded
before.

0.1.2
=====

Rename :py:func:`.Kpoints.coordinates` to :py:func:`.Kpoints.ticks`.
Both methods are available until the version 0.3.0. Deprecation warning is printed every time
:py:func:`.Kpoints.coordinates` is used.
