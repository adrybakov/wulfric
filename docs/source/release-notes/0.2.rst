Version 0.2

Whats new?
----------
Whole WULFRIC was refactored. Majority of the functionality remained the same,
however in some parts of the package the interface or the internal organization changed.
Therefore version 0.2 introduce some breaking changes:

* :py:class:`.Atom`

  - Spin and magnetic moment are related trough :py:attr:`.Atom.g_factor`.
  - Spin, magnetic moment now have default values and always return a value
    (previously if undefined they raised a ``ValueError``).

* :py:class:`.Lattice`

  - :py:meth:`.Lattice.type` - add ``delta_max`` parameter.
